Concept:
This is a Brain Controlled Wheelchair, which works just by an EEG device that sits on the patients forehead and captures all the brain signals.

Getting started:
These instruction will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purpose. 

Prerequisities:
Sound knowledge of python programming
Good grip in using Rpi

Built with: Raspberry pi 3B+, Neurosky Mindwave mobile 2, ultronosic sensor, gyroscope, motor driver and DC motors   

General instructions:
Boot the rpi by installing an OS in it. Preferablly Rasbian
Once booted, open Python IDE
Start writing the code/editing
Once done, save it and open terminal
Set the appropriate directory in the terminal
Wear the Neuropy headset, switch it on, look for a blue light on it, and make sure it is firmly touching your forehead
Run rfcomm
Once done, execute run.py
In case of an error stop the code and rerun it.
